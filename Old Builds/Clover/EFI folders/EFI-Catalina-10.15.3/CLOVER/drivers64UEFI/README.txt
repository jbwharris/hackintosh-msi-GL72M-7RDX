EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI has been replaced by EFI/CLOVER/drivers/BIOS and You can remove it safely.
Starting from Clover r4983 Clovers loads drivers from new directories, however for retro compatibility search for the old drivers64UEFI if the new path is missing.
Anyway only EFI/CLOVER/drivers/UEFI is updated by the package installer.
