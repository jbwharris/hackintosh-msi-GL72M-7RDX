## :muscle: Upgrades

### Wifi Card
You need to purchase a Broadcom DW1820A BCM94350ZAE 2.4G/5G Dual Band 867Mbps M.2 NGFF WiFi Card with Bluetooth 4.1 (for example or other wifi adapter for "naive" work) for correctly working wifi. 

### 256GB Apacer AS350 PANTHER  SSD
Main boot drive for this machine.

## :older_man: BIOS Configuration
I use the latest version of bios - 309. You can update bios [here](https://www.asus.com/supportonly/X542UQ/HelpDesk_BIOS/). <br> For installation without any troubles you need to edit some setting in bios that provided below

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Installation Notes

### Installation of Catalina by using this repository
If you want to install it quick - you can download DEBUG or RELEASE version, create the boot flash [(see more)](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) and copy DEBUG or RELEASE EFI folder into mounted EFI partition (on your flash). In config.plist there are already generated serial numbers, but its better to change them using the [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). `Attenton!` The eGPU is disabled via [IORegistryExplorer](https://github.com/acidanthera/gfxutil/releases), [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/spoof.html).

### USB Port Limit 
I used USBMap to fix my USB ports, along with a few other issues. It generated a new USBPorts.kext for my system and installed it in kexts/other. If you want to generate it by yourself you can use this tool and guide - [USBMapping Guide By Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/intel-mapping/intel.html).


### Wifi using 
If you want wifi to work you need to buy Broadcom DW1820A BCM94350ZAE module. If you have an Wi-Fi usb adapter here is a guide for you [Wireless USB Adapter](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-OC-Big-Sur-Adapter). Be carefully with kext after installation, because in my case it did not worked untill i swapped RtWlanU.kext and RtWlanU1827.kext loading priorities in the config.plist.

### Getting the touchpad and buttons to function
In the kext folder there are 2 kexts for I2C touchpad - VoodooI2C and VoodooI2CHID. Due to I have and ELAN1200 version of touchpad this protocol needs to use VoodooI2CHID. But I have only one problem - in some programs or workspaces (like Desktop) left button behaves like right button (cant drag and files).

### Sleep/Wake functionality problems
This laptop can be taken to sleep correctly without a charger connected to it. If we plug in the AC the laptop will awake in a few seconds after hibernation. This happens due to asus laptops peculiarities. But if you find the solution, feel free to contribute .
