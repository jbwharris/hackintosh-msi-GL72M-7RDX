#  MSI GL72M 7RDX Hackintosh Laptop

I have functioning builds for both Clover and OpenCore. The OpenCore build still has a screen flicker problem that I haven't been able to reconcile, so I've gone back to using Clover as my daily platform.

### [Clover Build](https://github.com/jbwharris/hackintosh-msi-GL72M-7RDX/tree/master/Clover)

### [OpenCore Build](https://github.com/jbwharris/hackintosh-msi-GL72M-7RDX/tree/master/OpenCore)
